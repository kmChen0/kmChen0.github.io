I am Kangming Chen, come from China. Now I am a PhD student in the [System Optimization Lab](http://www-optima.amp.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/).
Previously, my research focused on multi-objective optimization. Currently, I am also working on optimization algorithms on manifolds.

<!-- I've been working on Manifold optimization recently. 
My research is currently centered around exploring vector optimization on Riemannian manifolds. This exploration notably includes the application and advancement of conjugate, proximal, and conditional gradient methods. --> 

Interests: Continuous Optimization, Multiobjective Optimization, Manifold Optimization.

<!--I am actively seeking postdoctoral or assistant professor positions to further my research career. I am passionate about continuing my work in optimization and mathematical engineering and related fields and am eager to contribute to and collaborate with a dynamic research team. Please feel free to contact me for potential opportunities.-->
