I am Kangming Chen, come from China. Now I am a PhD student in the [System Optimization Lab](http://www-optima.amp.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/).
I'm currently working on an extension of gradient descent, now doing conjugate and proximal gradient methods, for vector optimization on Riemannian manifolds.

Interests: Multiobjective optimization, Manifold optimization.
