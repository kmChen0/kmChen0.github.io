I am Kangming Chen, come from China. Now I am a PhD student in the [System Optimization Lab](http://www-optima.amp.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/).
I've been working on Manifold optimization recently, and I'm currently working on an extension of the descent method, now doing conjugate and proximal gradient methods, for vector optimization on Riemannian manifolds.

Interests: Multiobjective Optimization, Manifold Optimization, Bilevel Optimization.

Please feel free to contact me if there is any interest.
