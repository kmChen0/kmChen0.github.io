I am Kangming Chen, come from China. Now I am a PhD student in the [System Optimization Lab](http://www-optima.amp.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/), Japan.
I've been working on Multiobjective optimization and Manifold optimization. 
My research is currently centered around exploring vector optimization on Riemannian manifolds. This exploration notably includes the application and advancement of conjugate, proximal, and conditional gradient methods.

Interests: Continuous Optimization, Multiobjective Optimization, Manifold Optimization.


Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have anything interested.
